Goal:
    Music guessing game

Details:
    The player will be able to add songs and then try to guess them in the game. 
    Will have a menu with option a) Play Game, b) Add Song, c) Highscore

Plan:
    for a):
        Play the song
        Get the answer
        Ask for player name in the end
        For guessing:
            (Easier) Add a list of answers to choose from
            (Harder) Use string distance to help recognize the answer if it's not exact 
    for b):
        Add a list for the directories of songs / file explorer
        Add possibility to download from url with requests library
    for c):
        Add CSV file to save the player Highscores
            - Create it if it's not there
            - Read it if it's there
        (optional) Use statistics library somehow


Notes:
    TO-DO:
        - Limit highscores to 10 best records

    Hardcoded:
        ln.40 - correct_guess
        ln.42 - song path
        ln.46 - options
        ln.50 - song range
