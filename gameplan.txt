Goal:
    Music guessing game

Details:
    The player will be able to add songs and then try to guess them in the game. 
    Will have a menu with option a) Play Game, b) Add Song, c) Highscore

Plan:
    for a):
        Add multithreading to play the song
        Add multithreading for timer. Points will depend on the time it took you to guess the song
        Add multithreading to get the answer
        Ask for player name in the end
        For guessing:
            (Easier) Add a list of answers to choose from
            (Harder) Add string distance to make the answer not exact 
    for b):
        Add a list for the directories of songs
        Add possibility to download from url
    for c):
        Add CSV file to save the player Highscores
            - Create it if it's not there
            - Read it if it's there
        (optional) Use statistics library somehow


Notes:
    TO-DO:
        - Limit highscores to 10 best records

    Hardcoded:
        ln.40 - correct_guess
        ln.42 - song path
        ln.46 - options
        ln.50 - song range
